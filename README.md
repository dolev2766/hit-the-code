# hit the code game

that is the first "game" I created in c.

##hit the code explain:

#####The rules are as follows:
**1:** In each round you try to guess the secret password (4 distinct digits)
**2:** After every guess you'll receive two hints about the password
**HITS:**   The number of digits in your guess which were exactly right.
**MISSES:** The number of digits in your guess which belongs to
the password but were miss-placed.
also you can choose the level do you want - 
- **easy(20 rounds)**
- **moderate (15 rounds)**
- **hard (10 rounds)**
- **craazy (random number of rounds 5 - 25)**

I do that to get a more expiriance in c and to complete the semester in magshimim(cyber eduction).

From this project I learned about functions, loop and random in c.


enjoy :)
